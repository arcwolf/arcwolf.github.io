<!-- ### Message
> I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at Kyoto University, working in department of electrical engineering. As a member of Hikihara Lab: Laboratory of Advanced Electrical Systems Theory, I have accomplished broad and plentiful understandings in communication/power system, dynamical analysis, and network engineering. The skillful communication and sense of teamwork have been learned from the extensive within-lab researches and several international studies. The leading innovation comes from the open discussion and small start. I kindly hope my skills and knowledges could contribute to your research group through a valuable opportunity.
